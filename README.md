Use this plugin to show the current year for your copyright in your footer or on policy pages.

Using the Shortcode

In Posts or Pages: Directly type [current-year] in the editor.

In Widgets: Add a “Text” or “Custom HTML” widget in your sidebar or footer and place [current-year] in the widget content.

In Menus: If your theme or a plugin supports shortcodes in menu items, simply add [current-year] to the menu label.

Once placed, the shortcode will automatically render the current year (e.g., 2025) dynamically, without further edits.
